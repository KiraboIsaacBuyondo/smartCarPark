# smartCarPark
 
 The Car Parking is enhanced and automated by this project. 
 Using IR proximity sensors to manage the entry and exit of cars in the parking, A servo motor is the barrier to close or open the park. 
 The parking has 4 parking slots whose availability is reduced and incremented upon entry or exit of cars.
 The parking slot availability is displayed on an LCD at the entrance
 If the parking space is used up, No car is allowed to enter. The barrier won't open.
 We look forward to extending this project to more IoT functionality and features
